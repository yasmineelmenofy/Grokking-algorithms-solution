Chapter 1 Exercises:

1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
steps it would take?

*log₂(128)=7

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
number of steps now?

*log₂(256)=8

Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O.
1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number
in the phone book.

*Search Method: Since the phone book is sorted by name, you can use a binary search.
 Big O Notation: O(log₂(n))

1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name
in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole
book!)

*Search Method: simple linear search.
 Big O Notation: O(n) 

1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.
*Big O Notation of worst case scenario : O(n) 

1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As
*Big O Notation: to find the section is O(log₂(n) ) to read all a section is O(n)so it is simplified to O(n)
