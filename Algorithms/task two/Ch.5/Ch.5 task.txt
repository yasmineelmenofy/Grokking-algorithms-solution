Ch.5 Exercise :

Which of these hash functions are consistent?
5.1 f(x) = 1 Returns “1” for all input

_Consistent as it gives a constant value when a specific name is entered 

5.2 f(x) = rand() Returns a random number every time

_Not consistent as it enters random value so the value for each key is not constant every time the same key is entered different value is given to it 

5.3 f(x) = next_empty_slot()

_Not consistent because it depends on the current state of the hash table

5.4 f(x) = len(x)

_consistent because the length of the string is constant for each input
