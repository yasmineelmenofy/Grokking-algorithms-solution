Ch.8 Exercise :

8.1 You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture
all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the
space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize
space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the
optimal solution?

_NO , that would not give the optimal solution because the greedy strategy will begin packing the big boxes until the truck cannot take more boxes and that may lead to wasted space in the truck instead of that we could take more small box that would fit the complete space 

8.2 You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything
you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want
to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the
point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your
stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal
solution?  

_ No, that would not give optimal solution because the strategy will start with things that takes high point until you can not do anything more despite of being able to still doing  the high point things in the left time 

8.3 Quicksort
 No

8.4 Breadth-first search
 Yes

8.5 Dijkstra’s algorithm
 Yes

8.6 A postman needs to deliver to 20 homes. He needs to find the
shortest route that goes to all 20 homes. Is this an NP-complete
problem?
 Yes

8.7 Finding the largest clique in a set of people (a clique is a set
of people who all know each other). Is this an NP-complete
problem?
 Yes

8.8 You’re making a map of the USA, and you need to color adjacent
states with different colors. You have to find the minimum
number of colors you need so that no two adjacent states are the
same color. Is this an NP-complete problem? 
Yes
