Ch.3 Exercises :

3.1 Suppose I show you a call stack like this.
What information can you give me, just based on this call stack? 

*IN side the function greet there is a call to the function greet 2 that is called recursion when a function call itself or call another function after getting out from function greet 2 it will be destroyed and only the box of the function greet will remain 

3.2 Suppose you accidentally write a recursive function that runs
forever. As you saw, your computer allocates memory on the
stack for each function call. What happens to the stack when your
recursive function runs forever?

*It will cause infinite recursion it will keeping itself indefinitely adding more frames to the stack which will cause  a stack overflow
